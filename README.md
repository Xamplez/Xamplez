## Welcome to Xamplez
#### Building an OpenSource Knowledge Cluster of Code Snippets

<br/>
### Xamplez's idea?

Xamplez is based on a very simple idea: 
> I want to share code snippets (and nothing else) about a given topic and be able to search them based 
> on tags, ratings etc...

<br/>

### What's Xamplez?

Firstly, let's quote a well known writer:
> One Gist to rule them all, One Gist to find them,

> One Gist to bring them all and in the whatever-ness bind them

#### For the code sharers

Our primary goal is to help people build knowledge bases of code snippets focusing on precise topics
(from the very generic such as programming language or frameworks to the more specific such as 
very precise technical points).

To achieve this common goal, we aim at providing a few common rule

By establishing a very few rules to follow and a few mechanisms to use, we 

To afford this, we have established a few rules to 
 * a very few rules to follow to 
 * encouraging people to fork Xamplez core and create **multiple instances focused on different topics**

For now, a instance of Xamplez

by **forking a core opensource server**.

Xamplez core project provides common mechanisms but can be fully customizable. 

For each big topic (a langage like Java, Js, Scala, Haskell,... or a framework playframework, angular, ...),
we would like people to fork core server... 

#### For the users

 * Code snippets about a topic
 * Only code snippets
 * Nothing else than code snippets

#### Why not use StackOverflow?
>Hmmmm, because Gist is really cool ?
>Hmmmm, because we want to talk about code and nothing else


### Prerequisites

 * Gist / Github
 * Play 2.1
 * Elastic Search
