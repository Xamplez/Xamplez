# Xamplez, knowledge cluster of code snippets

> One Gist to rule them all, One Gist to find them,
>
> One Gist to bring them all and in the whatever-ness bind them

## The idea behind XampleZ

### Client side

 * Code snippets about a topic
 * Only code snippets
 * Nothing else than code snippets

### Server side

We aim at providing a **_"standard"_ way of building a knowledge base of code snippets** about a given topic 
by **forking a core opensource server**.

Xamplez core project provides common mechanisms but can be fully customizable. 

xamplez.io could be used as base URL for all Xamplez instances.

### Prerequisites

 * Gist / Github
 * Play 2.1
 * Elastic Search
