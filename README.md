## Welcome to Xamplez
#### Building an OpenSource Knowledge Cluster of Code Snippets

<br/>
### Xamplez's idea?

Xamplez is based on a very simple idea: 
> I want to share code snippets (and nothing else) about a given topic and be able to search them based 
> on tags, ratings etc...

<br/>

### What's Xamplez?

Firstly, let's quote a well known writer:
> One Gist to rule them all, One Gist to find them,
>
> One Gist to bring them all and in the whatever-ness bind them

#### For the sharers

We aim at providing a **_"standard"_ way of building a knowledge base of code snippets** about a given topic 
by **forking a core opensource server**.

Xamplez core project provides common mechanisms but can be fully customizable. 

For each big topic (a langage like Java, Js, Scala, Haskell,... or a framework playframework, angular, ...),
we would like people to fork core server... 

#### For the users

 * Code snippets about a topic
 * Only code snippets
 * Nothing else than code snippets

#### Why not use StackOverflow?
>Hmmmm, because Gist is really cool ?
>Hmmmm, because we want to talk about code and nothing else


### Prerequisites

 * Gist / Github
 * Play 2.1
 * Elastic Search
